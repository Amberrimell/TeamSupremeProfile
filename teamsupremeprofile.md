“The results of an online Myers-Briggs Test reveal  that I am a CONSUL ESFJ-A personality type with Mind: a trait determining how we interact with our environment (51 % Extraverted ; 49 % Introverted); Energy: a trait showing where we direct our mental energy (34 % Intuitive ; 66 % Observant); Nature: This trait determines how we make decisions and cope with emotions (29 %Thinking ; 71 % Feeling) ;  Tactics: This trait reflects our approach to work, planning and decision making (75 % Judging ; 25 % Prospecting); Identity: This trait underpins all others, showing how confident we are in our abilities and decisions. (61 % Assertive 39 % Turbulent ). ( From www.16personaities.com/esfj-personality)”

“The results of an online learning style test indicate that I am primarily a(n): visual learner. “ The visual learner remembers 75 % of what they read or see.  Demonstrations from the blackboard,diagrams, graphs and charts are all valuable tools for the visual learner.  Generally, analytic visual learners will process the printed word before the iconic (pictorial) information.  Generally, global visual learners will process iconic (pictorial) information before reading the printed text. ( From www.whatismylearningstyle.com/visual-learner.html)”


**Amber Rimell**

According to the **16 Personalities** test, I am a Defender (ISFJ-A). I read through the results and found them to be quite accurate.

The **“What’s Your Learning Style?”** test has shown that I am a Visual learner. I agree. I picture words and images in my head, and repeat them to make sure they stick in my memory. I also like to type or write things out to make sure I’m really taking all the information in.
This shows that I am better at text conversations than I am at talking. I like to re-read conversations and info as needed.

The **DISC Personality** test results state that I am - in order of most to least: Steady, Compliant, Influential, Dominant. They say that ‘You are determined to achieve objectives. You are a clear thinker. You like to pursue a definite course of action. You respond to logic rather than emotion.’. I very much agree with these statements.
This shows that I like to get things done in a concise manner and have a clear path ahead. I am happy to follow but also feel comfortable leading.

**The Learning Style Test**

Based on this test, it advises that I am a 40% auditory learner. I believe that this is true as it is easier for me to memorise work by listening to the explanation. I also benefit from Visual learning as it visualising the process also helps me memorise the work.

**The Myers-Brigg Test**

The above test indicates that I am organised, responsible, efficient and value experience. I believe that this is true as I like to plan ahead to ensure that I know what I am doing or to prepare enough time to learn the things i need to know before completing my task. I do believe that gaining experience can benefit anyone in any part of their daily life whether it is work, your social life or your private life.

**The Aptitude Test**

The results of the aptitude/psychometric test show that I am able to read through verbal data, identify critical issues and reach logical conclusions. The test compares your results with those who have also taken it who have a score of 7 or more place you in a higher position compared to the average person's result.

## Ideal Jobs

**John Efthimiadis**



**Amber Rimell**

*Senior Gameplay Programmer*

As a Senior Gameplay Programmer, there will be a lot of coding & debugging involved.

The applicant needs the ability to:
- Design, document & develop Core Gameplay Systems
- Adapt
- Problem solve
- Collaborate
- Have great written & oral communication
- Design & implement Game Systems such as: User Interface, Animation, Gameplay Scripting, Online Networking

I imagine that all of our dream jobs are going to require the ability to collaborate and work with others. 

**Vu Tran**

At the moment I am unsure of which pathway that I would like to choose. I am interested in being a Game Developer and a Cyber Security Specialist however I amm leaning more to being a Game Developer because of my interests in video games. The role would require you to have the skills to develop, design and program the game. You will need to solve bugs that arise during gameplay and program same for minor issues that can affect the game. You will need to work co-operatively with co-workers throughout the development of the game to ensure the best content for the users.
