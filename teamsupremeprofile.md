**John Efthimiadis**



**Amber Rimell**

My name is Amber Rimell, my student number is S3775604, and I am currently undertaking a Bachelor of IT part-time. I intend to further my studies after this and get a Masters degree. 
I am a Kiwi, though I’ve been in Australia since I was 10. I have a 1.5 year old daughter. I like baking and video games. I have a love for computers, Playstations and all things tech. I aspire to work as a Senior Gameplay Programmer. 
I don’t have much IT experience other than working in administration roles, using Microsoft Office frequently, and using other softwares such as MYOB. I have always been the go-to girl for fixing computer problems, though I have no professional background.

## Team Profile

The test outcomes for each person in the team (all 3 tests), and your understanding of how this information may be helpful to the group. You should do this as soon as your group is formed. You will have a chance to reflect on how well the group has worked later.

**Amber Rimell's test outcomes:**

According to the **16 Personalities** test, I am a Defender (ISFJ-A). I read through the results and found them to be quite accurate.

The **“What’s Your Learning Style?”** test has shown that I am a Visual learner. I agree. I picture words and images in my head, and repeat them to make sure they stick in my memory. I also like to type or write things out to make sure I’m really taking all the information in.
This shows that I am better at text conversations than I am at talking. I like to re-read conversations and info as needed.

The **DISC Personality** test results state that I am - in order of most to least: Steady, Compliant, Influential, Dominant. They say that ‘You are determined to achieve objectives. You are a clear thinker. You like to pursue a definite course of action. You respond to logic rather than emotion.’. I very much agree with these statements.
This shows that I like to get things done in a concise manner and have a clear path ahead. I am happy to follow but also feel comfortable leading.
