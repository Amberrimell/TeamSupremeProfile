**John Efthimiadis' test outcomes:**

“The results of an online Myers-Briggs Test reveal  that I am a CONSUL ESFJ-A personality type with Mind: a trait determining how we interact with our environment (51 % Extraverted ; 49 % Introverted); Energy: a trait showing where we direct our mental energy (34 % Intuitive ; 66 % Observant); Nature: This trait determines how we make decisions and cope with emotions (29 %Thinking ; 71 % Feeling) ;  Tactics: This trait reflects our approach to work, planning and decision making (75 % Judging ; 25 % Prospecting); Identity: This trait underpins all others, showing how confident we are in our abilities and decisions. (61 % Assertive 39 % Turbulent ). ( From www.16personaities.com/esfj-personality)”

“The results of an online learning style test indicate that I am primarily a(n): visual learner. “ The visual learner remembers 75 % of what they read or see.  Demonstrations from the blackboard,diagrams, graphs and charts are all valuable tools for the visual learner.  Generally, analytic visual learners will process the printed word before the iconic (pictorial) information.  Generally, global visual learners will process iconic (pictorial) information before reading the printed text. ( From www.whatismylearningstyle.com/visual-learner.html)”


**Amber Rimell's test outcomes:**

According to the **16 Personalities** test, I am a Defender (ISFJ-A). I read through the results and found them to be quite accurate.

The **“What’s Your Learning Style?”** test has shown that I am a Visual learner. I agree. I picture words and images in my head, and repeat them to make sure they stick in my memory. I also like to type or write things out to make sure I’m really taking all the information in.
This shows that I am better at text conversations than I am at talking. I like to re-read conversations and info as needed.

The **DISC Personality** test results state that I am - in order of most to least: Steady, Compliant, Influential, Dominant. They say that ‘You are determined to achieve objectives. You are a clear thinker. You like to pursue a definite course of action. You respond to logic rather than emotion.’. I very much agree with these statements.
This shows that I like to get things done in a concise manner and have a clear path ahead. I am happy to follow but also feel comfortable leading.
